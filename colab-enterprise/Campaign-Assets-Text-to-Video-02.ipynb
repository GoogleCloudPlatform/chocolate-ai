    "This process streamlines marketing video creation by having Gemini simultaneously generate both the script and corresponding Veo 2 prompts, incorporating ABCD best practices for each 6-second segment. Veo 2 then generates the video segments, which are narrated with English and French voice overs using Vertex AI's text-to-speech. Finally, Gemini performs a quality assurance check on the assembled video.\n",
    "\n",
    "Process Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Transform the Veo 2 comprehensive documentation into a set of clear instructions that specifically guide the creation of effective Veo 2 prompts.\n",
    "2. Create a prompt for Gemini that will:\n",
    "    * a. A prompt should include \"styles\", \"composition\", \"Ambiance & Emotions\", \"Cinematic effects\" (doc)\n",
    "    * a. Let Gemini know that the video will be generated in 6 second segments\n",
    "    * b. Ask Gemini for the script and the video prompt\n",
    "    * c. Also, inform Gemini about the ABCD detector rules so it can determine which rules apply per segment\n",
    "3. Use GenAI to generate videos via Veo 2\n",
    "4. Use Vertex AI text-to-speech to generate the voice over using a British accent and a male voice\n",
    "5. Use Vertex AI text-to-speech to generate the voice over using a French accent and a male voice\n",
    "6. Overlay the text-to-speech to each video segment\n",
    "7. Merge all the video segments into one final video.\n",
    "8. Ask Gemini for a Quality Assurance check of the generated video.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The notebook does merge the videos, but the quality is much better when you merge with a high quality video tool. The text-to-speech does not always align perfectly with the video.\n",
    "2. You can also adjust the speed of the text-to-speech to control how fast the words are spoken.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost:\n",
    "* Veo 2: 50 cents per second of video \n",
    "* Medium: Remember to stop your Colab Enterprise Notebook Runtime\n",

    "Here are some our best practices for text-to-video prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed prompts = better videos:\n",
    "  - More details you add, the more control you’ll have over the video. A prompt should look like this:\n",
    "  - Example Prompt: \"Camera dollies to show a close up of a desperate man in a green trench coat is making a call on a rotary style wall-phone, green neon light, movie scene.\"\n",
    "    - Here is a break down of a text-to-video prompt:\n",
    "    - Camera dollies to show = Camera motion\n",
    "    - A close up of = Composition\n",
    "    - A desperate man in a green trench coat = Subject\n",
    "    - Is making a call = Action\n",
    "    - On a roary style wall-phone = Scene\n",
    "    - Green Neon light = Ambiance\n",
    "    - Movie Scene = Style\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the right keywords for better control:\n",
    "  - We’ve identified a list of some keywords that work well with text-to-video, use these in your human written prompts to get the desired camera motion or style.\n",
    "  - Subject: Who or what is the main focus of the shot e.g. happy woman in her 30s\n",
    "  - Scene: Where is the location of the shot (on a busy street, in space)\n",
    "  - Action: What is the subject doing (walking, running, turning head)\n",
    "  - Camera Motion: What the camera is doing e.g. POV shot, Aerial View, Tracking Drone view, Tracking Shot\n",
    "    - Example Camera Motion: \"Tracking drone view of a man driving a red convertible car in Palm Springs, 1970s, warm sunlight, long shadows\"\n",
    "    - Example Camera Motion: \"A POV shot from a vintage car driving in the rain, Canada at night, cinematic\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Styles:\n",
    "   - Overall aesthetic. Consider using specific film style keywords e.g. horror film, film noir or animated styles e.g. 3D cartoon style render\n",
    "  - Example Prompt: \"Over the shoulder of a young woman in a car, 1970s, film grain, horror film, cinematic he Film noir style, man and woman walk on the street, mystery, cinematic, black and white\"\n",
    "  - Example Prompt: \"A cute creatures with snow leopard-like fur is walking in winter forest, 3D cartoon style render. An architectural rendering of a white concrete apartment building with flowing organic shapes, seamlessly blending with lush greenery and futuristic elements.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition:\n",
    "  - How the shot is framed. This is often relative to the subject e.g. wide shot, close-up, low angle\n",
    "  - Example Prompt: \"Extreme close-up of a an eye with city reflected in it. A wide shot of surfer walking on a beach with a surfboard, beautiful sunset, cinematic\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ambiance & Emotions:\n",
    "  - How the color and light contribute to the scene (blue tones, night)\n",
    "  - Example Prompt: \"A close-up of a girl holding adorable golden retriever puppy in the park, sunlight Cinematic close-up shot of a sad woman riding a bus in the rain, cool blue tones, sad mood\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Cinematic effects:\n",
    "  - e.g. double exposure, projected, glitch camera effect\n",
    "  - Example Prompt: \"A double exposure of silhouetted profile of a woman walking and lake, walking in a forest Close-up shot of a model with blue light with geometric shapes projected on her face\"\n",
    "  - Example Prompt: \"Silhouette of a man walking in collage of cityscapes Glitch camera effect, close up of woman’s face speaking, neon colors\"\n",

    "Text-to-Video Prompt Writing Help:\n",
    "<text-to-video-prompt-guide>\n",
    "Here are some our best practices for text-to-video prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed prompts = better videos:\n",
    "  - More details you add, the more control you’ll have over the video. A prompt should look like this:\n",
    "  - Example Prompt: \"Camera dollies to show a close up of a desperate man in a green trench coat is making a call on a rotary style wall-phone, green neon light, movie scene.\"\n",
    "    - Here is a break down of a text-to-video prompt:\n",
    "    - Camera dollies to show = Camera motion\n",
    "    - A close up of = Composition\n",
    "    - A desperate man in a green trench coat = Subject\n",
    "    - Is making a call = Action\n",
    "    - On a roary style wall-phone = Scene\n",
    "    - Green Neon light = Ambiance\n",
    "    - Movie Scene = Style\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the right keywords for better control:\n",
    "  - We’ve identified a list of some keywords that work well with text-to-video, use these in your human written prompts to get the desired camera motion or style.\n",
    "  - Subject: Who or what is the main focus of the shot e.g. happy woman in her 30s\n",
    "  - Scene: Where is the location of the shot (on a busy street, in space)\n",
    "  - Action: What is the subject doing (walking, running, turning head)\n",
    "  - Camera Motion: What the camera is doing e.g. POV shot, Aerial View, Tracking Drone view, Tracking Shot\n",
    "    - Example Camera Motion: \"Tracking drone view of a man driving a red convertible car in Palm Springs, 1970s, warm sunlight, long shadows\"\n",
    "    - Example Camera Motion: \"A POV shot from a vintage car driving in the rain, Canada at night, cinematic\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Styles:\n",
    "   - Overall aesthetic. Consider using specific film style keywords e.g. horror film, film noir or animated styles e.g. 3D cartoon style render\n",
    "  - Example Prompt: \"Over the shoulder of a young woman in a car, 1970s, film grain, horror film, cinematic he Film noir style, man and woman walk on the street, mystery, cinematic, black and white\"\n",
    "  - Example Prompt: \"A cute creatures with snow leopard-like fur is walking in winter forest, 3D cartoon style render. An architectural rendering of a white concrete apartment building with flowing organic shapes, seamlessly blending with lush greenery and futuristic elements.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition:\n",
    "  - How the shot is framed. This is often relative to the subject e.g. wide shot, close-up, low angle\n",
    "  - Example Prompt: \"Extreme close-up of a an eye with city reflected in it. A wide shot of surfer walking on a beach with a surfboard, beautiful sunset, cinematic\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ambiance & Emotions:\n",
    "  - How the color and light contribute to the scene (blue tones, night)\n",
    "  - Example Prompt: \"A close-up of a girl holding adorable golden retriever puppy in the park, sunlight Cinematic close-up shot of a sad woman riding a bus in the rain, cool blue tones, sad mood\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Cinematic effects:\n",
    "  - e.g. double exposure, projected, glitch camera effect\n",
    "  - Example Prompt: \"A double exposure of silhouetted profile of a woman walking and lake, walking in a forest Close-up shot of a model with blue light with geometric shapes projected on her face\"\n",
    "  - Example Prompt: \"Silhouette of a man walking in collage of cityscapes Glitch camera effect, close up of woman’s face speaking, neon colors\"\n",
