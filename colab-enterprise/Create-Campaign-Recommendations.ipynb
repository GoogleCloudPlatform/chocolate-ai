    "This notebook demonstrates a process for generating marketing campaign recommendations for Chocolate AI, a fictional French chocolatier and bakery. It leverages BigQuery for data storage and analysis, Gemini (a large language model) for creative content generation, and TimesFM (a time series forecasting model) for predicting campaign performance. Informed by your existing data, Gen AI can create powerful campaign recommendations to jumpstart your marketing teamâ€™s efforts. Marketing projects that previously took weeks to plan and brainstorm can be rapidly prototyped using Gen AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Process Flow:\n",
    "1. Define Campaign Recommendation Functions:\n",
    "    - GenerateCampaignRecommendations: Uses Gemini LLM to suggest campaign ideas based on provided goals, product information, and budget.\n",
    "    - GetRankedProducts: Queries BigQuery to identify under-performing products based on sales changes over various time periods (daily, weekly, monthly).\n",
    "    - GetFinalProductRanking: Combines rankings from different time periods to produce a final list of products to consider for promotion.\n",
    "    - Visualize*: Several functions to create informative graphs for visualizing product rankings and campaign performance.\n",
    "    - GenerateCampaignPerformance: Simulates randomized campaign performance data influenced by budget.\n",
    "2. Campaign Generation Workflow:\n",
    "    - Step 1: Product Ranking:\n",
    "        - Retrieves and visualizes rankings of the lowest-performing products over different time periods.\n",
    "        - Combines these rankings into a final ranked list.\n",
    "        - Uploads the visualization to Google Cloud Storage and uses Gemini (with multi-modal input) to interpret the graph and suggest products for promotion.\n",
    "    - Step 2: Discount Optimization:\n",
    "        - Based on the selected product, uses TimesFM to simulate the impact of different discount levels on sales, recommending a discount to achieve the desired sales increase.\n",
    "    - Step 3: Campaign Ideation:\n",
    "        - Fetches product details from BigQuery.\n",
    "        - Calls GenerateCampaignRecommendations to create campaign ideas, including name, description, target audience, marketing channels, and expected outcomes.\n",
    "    - Step 4: Campaign Performance Simulation:\n",
    "        - Simulates the campaign's performance multiple times using GenerateCampaignPerformance to visualize potential outcomes.\n",
    "    - Step 5: Mock Campaign Execution and Results:\n",
    "        - Runs a final simulation to represent actual campaign results.\n",
    "        - Visualizes the performance of the simulated campaign.\n",
    "        - Saves the campaign details and simulated performance data into the BigQuery tables.\n",
