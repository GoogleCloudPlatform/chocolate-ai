        "1. ABCD Criteria & Assessment Functions:\n",
        "    - Define functions to evaluate each of the 23 ABCD features, using both Video Intelligence API annotations (e.g., shot detection, text detection) and Gemini LLM's understanding of video content.\n",
        "    - The LLM assesses video features through prompts tailored for each criterion.\n",
        "    - The functions calculate scores and provide detailed explanations for the assessments.\n",
        "2. Execute Assessment:\n",
        "    - Generates video annotations using the Video Intelligence API for all brand videos in the GCS bucket.\n",
        "    - Trims the videos to create 5-second versions for certain assessments.\n",
        "    - Executes the ABCD assessment for each video, combining API annotations and LLM evaluations.\n",
        "    - Parses the assessment results and prints a summary for each video, including score, overall result, and evaluation of each feature.\n",
        "3. Save Results:\n",
        "    - Saves the parsed results (brand name, video name, score, result text, feature details, feature_timestamps etc.) to the BigQuery table (campaign_abcd_results) for long-term analysis.\n",
